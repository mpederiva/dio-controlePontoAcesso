# REST APIs for attendance and access control

This is my version of [Rodolfo Gomes](https://github.com/rodolfogomes/diolive)' REST APIs for attendance and access control. Developed during Santander's [Bootcamp 2021](https://app.becas-santander.com/pt-BR/program/santanderbootcamp) scholarship program in partnership with [Digital Innovation One ](https://digitalinnovation.one/). We've used Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate Envers and lombok, besides documenting the API with Swagger.
